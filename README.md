Hey! Iâ€™m DeShon Dixon. A US Army Veteran, I've recently transitioned into software development. 

The languages I utilize the most are JavaScript and Python. 

What I bring to a team is that Iâ€™m very coachable, eager to learn, and easy to work with. Iâ€™ve always worked jobs that involve me finding solutions for customer needs and have a strong passion for problem solving. 

Iâ€™ve worked in sales, video editing, and as a mechanic in the army and they have always been favored because I listen with empathy and ensure expectations are met. Iâ€™m able to hold my own because Iâ€™m willing to listen to advice. I love to hear opinions on how I could be more effective. I strive to learn more and handle ambiguity well.
