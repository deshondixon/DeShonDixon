Welcome! I’m DeShon Dixon. A US Army Veteran, I've recently transitioned into software development. 
</p>

<p align="center">
The languages I utilize the most are JavaScript and Python. 
</p>

<p align="center">
What I bring to a team is that I’m very coachable, eager to learn, and easy to work with. I’ve always worked jobs that involve me finding solutions for customer needs and have a strong passion for problem solving. 
</p>
<p align="center" >
I’ve worked in sales, video editing, and as a mechanic in the army and they have always been favored because I listen with empathy and ensure expectations are met. I’m able to hold my own because I’m willing to listen to advice. I love to hear opinions on how I could be more effective. I strive to learn more and handle ambiguity well.
