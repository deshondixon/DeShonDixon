Iâ€™ve worked in sales, video editing, and as a mechanic in the army and they have always been favored because I listen with empathy and ensure expectations are met. Iâ€™m able to hold my own because Iâ€™m willing to listen to advice. I love to hear opinions on how I could be more effective. I strive to learn more and handle ambiguity well.
